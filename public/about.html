<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there. My name is Mark Gurgone and I am a 27-old living in Chicago. I am originally from the Bridgeport neighborhood
  on the south side of the city. Currently I'm learning the many languages of coding in order to gain a software developer position in the future. I've always liked the idea of learning to code, but in this current year coding has become very fascinating to me and I love the idea of figuring out each and every step to create something both useful and efficient. </p>

<p>On this portfolio website will be some basic projects I've worked on through my courses on HTML. Please take a look at them and enjoy!</p>
