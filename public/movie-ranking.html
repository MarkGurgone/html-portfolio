<h1>The Top 3 Must Watch Movies From The G's Perspective </h1>
<h2>My Overall Favorite Movies of All Times</h2>
<hr /> 

<h3>The Breakfast Club</h3>
<p>If you have not seen the breakfast club, then you are missing out. It is honestly one of the top comedic movies that brings together arrogant teens and makes them best friends.</p>


<h3>Rush Hour</h3>
<p> Imagine if two crazy actors were put together and did their own thing in an action-packed movie with comedy. That is essentially Rush Hour, starring Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker. These are two phenomenal actors who will make you cry as you watch Chris Tucker act like a terrible cop and Jackie act like a lost tourist. </p>
    
    
<h3>The Wizard of Oz</h3>
<p>Imagine being transported to a different world by being sucked away in a tornado while lying in your house. That's how the Wizard of Oz starts off, and overall, it leads to a fantastic story about a girl trying to make her way back home as she meets new companions and goes through challenges from a nasty witch. </p>
